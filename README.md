## Usage
    Usage: qmlfmt [options] path

    Without an explicit path, it processes the standard input. Given a file, it operates on that file; given a directory, it operates on all qml files in that directory, recursively. (Files starting with a period are ignored.) By default, qmlfmt prints the reformatted sources to standard output.

### Options:
    -?, -h, --help                   Displays help on commandline options.
    --help-all                       Displays help including Qt specific options.
    -v, --version                    Displays version information.
    -b, --line-length <line length>  How many characters before line will be
                                     broken.
    -t, --tab-size <tab size>        How many spaces to replace tabs with
    -i, --indent <indent>            How many spaces to use for indentation
    -l, --list                       Do not print reformatted sources to standard
                                     output. If a file's formatting is different
                                     from qmlfmt's, print its name to standard
                                     output.
    -w, --overwrite                  Do not print reformatted sources to standard
                                     output. If a file's formatting is different
                                     from qmlfmt's, overwrite it with qmlfmt's
                                     version.
    -e, --error                      Print all errors.
    -d, --diff                       Do not print reformatted sources to standard
                                     output. If a file's formatting is different
                                     than qmlfmt's, print diffs to standard
                                     output.

### Arguments:
    path                       file(s) or directory to process. If not set,
                               qmlfmt will process the standard input.
